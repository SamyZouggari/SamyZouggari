## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samy, a French student currently pursuing a degree in mathematics and computer science. After initially studying physical and chemical sciences, I had the opportunity to enter a good computer science school, and I seized it. I enjoy computer science because it combines creativity and problem-solving across various domains, including statistics, which particularly interests me. What I love most is the freedom to learn and practice at my own pace, right in front of my computer, without the pressure of memorizing endless formulas.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to French and American hip-hop, pop music, and lo-fi when I need to concentrate. My favourite artists are Kanye West, Travis Scott and Booba. I also like watching movies or TV shows, driving around to meet friends, and hitting the gym. I'm also constantly seeking new skills to acquire; for example, during vacations, I take online courses to learn HTML and CSS, expanding my web development knowledge.

In the future, I aspire to become a data scientist, though I'm open to other opportunities that may arise.
